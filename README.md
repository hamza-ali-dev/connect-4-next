# Connect Four

About this project
------------------

This project is a simple web-based connect 4 game for two players. It was built using `Next.js` and `Tailwind CSS`.

The game is designed to be played in a single browser tab, with the two players taking turns dropping their pieces into the grid. The first player to get four of their pieces in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all of the squares are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.
